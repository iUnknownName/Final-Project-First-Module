        <h1>What is Artificial Intelligence</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          Artificial intelligence, in computer science, is the set of systems or
          combination of algorithms, whose purpose is to create machines that
          mimic human intelligence to perform tasks and can improve according to
          the information they collect. Artificial intelligence is not intended
          to replace humans, but to significantly enhance human capabilities and
          contributions.
        </p>
        <br />
        Artificial intelligence currently encompasses a wide variety of
        subfields, ranging from general-purpose areas such as learning and
        perception to more specific ones such as playing chess, proving
        mathematical theorems, writing poetry, and learning, disease diagnosis.
        Artificial Intelligence synthesizes and automates tasks that are
        initially intellectual and is therefore potentially relevant to any
        field of human intellectual activity. In this sense, it is a genuinely
        universal field.

        <h2>AI Types:</h2>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Systems that think like humans:</b> These systems try to emulate
            human thinking; For example, artificial neural networks. The
            automation of activities that we link to human thought processes,
            activities such as decision making, problem solving and learning.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Systems that act like humans:</b> These systems try to act like
            humans; that is, they imitate human behavior; for example robotics
            (The study of how to make computers perform tasks that, for the
            moment, humans do better).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Systems that think rationally:</b> That is, with logic (ideally),
            they try to imitate the rational thought of the human being; for
            example, expert systems, (the study of calculations that make it
            possible to perceive, reason and act).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Systems that act rationally:</b> They try to rationally emulate
            human behavior; For example, intelligent agents, which is related to
            intelligent behavior in artifacts.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h2>Regulation</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Law plays a fundamental role in the use and development of AI. Laws
          establish binding rules and standards of behavior to ensure social
          welfare and protect individual rights, and can help us reap the
          benefits of this technology while minimizing its risks, which are
          significant. At the moment there are no legal regulations that
          directly regulate AI. But dated April 21, 2021, the European
          Commission has presented a proposal for a European Regulation for the
          harmonized regulation of artificial intelligence (AI) in the EU. Its
          exact title is
          <em
            >Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the
            Council establishing harmonized standards in the field of artificial
            intelligence Artificial Intelligence Law and modifying other
            legislative acts of the Union.</em
          >
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li><b>Reasoning and problem solving</b></li>
          <li><b>knowledge representation</b></li>
          <li><b>Planning</b></li>
          <li><b>Learning</b></li>
          <li><b>Natural Language Processing</b></li>
          <li><b>Perception</b></li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h2>Importance of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Helps automate repetitive learning and discovery through data,
          performs frequent computational tasks reliably, however requires human
          research for system configuration. Analyze more data and deeper data.
          It adds intelligence, since it cannot be sold as an individual
          application, so it is an added value to the products.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Critics</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          The main criticisms of artificial intelligence have to do with its
          ability to completely mimic a human being. However, there are experts
          [citation needed] on the subject who indicate that no individual human
          has the capacity to solve all kinds of problems, and authors such as
          Howard Gardner have theorized about the solution. In humans, the
          ability to solve problems has two aspects: the innate aspects and the
          learned aspects. The innate aspects allow, for example, to store and
          retrieve information in memory, while the learned aspects reside in
          knowing how to solve a mathematical problem using the appropriate
          algorithm. In the same way that a human must have tools that allow him
          to solve certain problems, artificial systems must be programmed in
          such a way that they can solve them.
