        <h1>What is Artificial Intelligence</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Artificial intelligence, in computer science, is the set of systems or combination of algorithms, whose purpose is to create machines that mimic human intelligence to perform tasks and can improve according to the information they collect. 
        Artificial intelligence is not intended to replace humans, but to significantly enhance human capabilities and contributions.</p>
        <br>
        Artificial intelligence currently encompasses a wide variety of subfields, ranging from general-purpose areas such as learning and perception to more specific ones such as playing chess, proving mathematical theorems, writing poetry, and learning, disease diagnosis.
        Artificial Intelligence synthesizes and automates tasks that are initially intellectual and is therefore potentially relevant to any field of human intellectual activity. 
        In this sense, it is a genuinely universal field.
        <br>
        <h2>AI Types:</h2>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Systems that think like humans:</b> These systems try to emulate human thinking; For example, artificial neural networks.
            The automation of activities that we link to human thought processes, activities such as decision making, problem solving and learning.</li>
            <li><b>Systems that act like humans:</b> These systems try to act like humans; that is, they imitate human behavior; for example robotics (The study of how to make computers perform tasks that, for the moment, humans do better).</li>
            <li><b>Systems that think rationally:</b> That is, with logic (ideally), they try to imitate the rational thought of the human being; for example, expert systems, (the study of calculations that make it possible to perceive, reason and act).</li>
            <li><b>Systems that act rationally:</b> They try to rationally emulate human behavior; For example, intelligent agents, which is related to intelligent behavior in artifacts.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Regulation</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Law plays a fundamental role in the use and development of AI. Laws establish binding rules and standards of behavior to ensure social welfare and protect individual rights, and can help us reap the benefits of this technology while minimizing its risks, which are significant. 
            At the moment there are no legal regulations that directly regulate AI. But dated April 21, 2021, the European Commission has presented a proposal for a European Regulation for the harmonized regulation of artificial intelligence (AI) in the EU. 
            Its exact title is <em>Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing harmonized standards in the field of artificial intelligence Artificial Intelligence Law and modifying other legislative acts of the Union.</em></p>
        <br>
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Reasoning and problem solving</b></li>
            <li><b>knowledge representation</b></li>
            <li><b>Planning</b></li>
            <li><b>Learning</b></li>
            <li><b>Natural Language Processing</b></li>
            <li><b>Perception</b></li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Importance of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Helps automate repetitive learning and discovery through data, performs frequent computational tasks reliably, however requires human research for system configuration. 
        Analyze more data and deeper data. It adds intelligence, since it cannot be sold as an individual application, so it is an added value to the products.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Critics</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The main criticisms of artificial intelligence have to do with its ability to completely mimic a human being. However, there are experts [citation needed] on the subject who indicate that no individual human has the capacity to solve all kinds of problems, and authors such as Howard Gardner have theorized about the solution.
            In humans, the ability to solve problems has two aspects: the innate aspects and the learned aspects. The innate aspects allow, for example, to store and retrieve information in memory, while the learned aspects reside in knowing how to solve a mathematical problem using the appropriate algorithm. 
            In the same way that a human must have tools that allow him to solve certain problems, artificial systems must be programmed in such a way that they can solve them.</p>

            <p><em>In our business, we talk about emerging technologies and how they impact society.
                We have never seen a technology that moves as fast as AI has an impact on society and technology. 
                This is by far the fastest moving technology we've tracked in terms of its impact and we're just getting started.</em></p>
